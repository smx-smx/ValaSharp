# ValaSharp
This project aims to port the existing Vala compiler to C#

As of now the compiler can build working programs just like valac, but it hasn't been tested extensively.

The longer term goal is to start making improvements and adding new features by taking advantage of the (as of now) better .NET development tools.
Newly made tools could then be used to improve the original (self hosting) Vala compiler aswell

The repository includes an experimental language server for Visual Studio Code, but it doesn't include code completion yet.
