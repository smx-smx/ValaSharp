# ValaSharp
The Vala Compiler, ported to C#

This project aims to port the existing Vala compiler to C#

The short term goal is to replicate the existing vala compiler and have reproducible results.

The longer term goal is to start improving the compiler by taking advantage of .NET development tools.
Such tools would be of help to improve the original (self hosting) Vala compiler aswell
